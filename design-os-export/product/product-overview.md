# Product Overview

## Product Name
Safety & Operations Portal

## Description
A mobile-first field safety management application designed for industrial and construction environments. The app enables field workers to complete daily hazard assessments (FLHAs), report hazards and incidents, and track corrective actions. Built for reliability in low-connectivity environments with offline-first architecture.

## Problems Solved

1. **Paper-based safety processes** — Traditional FLHA forms and incident reports are slow, error-prone, and hard to track. This portal digitizes the entire safety workflow.

2. **Field connectivity challenges** — Workers in remote locations often lack reliable internet. The offline-first design ensures safety documentation is never blocked by connectivity issues.

3. **Slow incident response** — When hazards are reported on paper, supervisors may not see them for hours or days. Real-time sync enables immediate visibility and faster corrective action.

4. **Compliance tracking gaps** — Without a central system, proving safety compliance to regulators is time-consuming. The portal maintains a complete audit trail.

5. **Worker accountability** — Ensuring all workers acknowledge daily hazard assessments is difficult to enforce manually. Digital acknowledgment creates clear records.

## Key Features

- **Field Level Hazard Assessment (FLHA)** — Supervisors create daily FLHAs; workers review and digitally acknowledge
- **Quick Hazard Reporting** — Simple form for reporting hazards and near-misses from the field
- **Incident Reporting** — Comprehensive incident/injury investigation reporting
- **Corrective Actions** — Track and manage safety actions with priority and due dates
- **Offline Support** — Full functionality without internet; syncs when connection available
- **Role-based Access** — Workers, supervisors, and admins see different capabilities
- **Status Indicators** — Clear online/offline status with pending sync count

## Target Users

- **Field Workers** — Complete FLHAs, report hazards, manage assigned actions
- **Supervisors** — Create FLHAs, review queue, approve/reject submissions
- **Safety Administrators** — Full system access, reporting, configuration

## Design Philosophy

Industrial control panel aesthetic with high-contrast elements, clear status indicators, and touch-optimized interfaces. The design prioritizes:
- Readability in bright outdoor conditions
- Large touch targets for gloved hands
- Clear visual hierarchy with industrial typography
- Status-at-a-glance with color-coded badges
